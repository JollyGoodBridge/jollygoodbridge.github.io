  <h1>The Shadow of Good Governance</h1>
  <h2>A Discworld story in the style of Sir Terry Pratchett</h2>

  <hr>

  <p><strong>1. The Problem With Power</strong></p>

  <p>Every great city has a shadow.<br>
  In Ankh-Morpork, the shadow <em>runs the place</em>.</p>

  <p>At the time this story takes place, Ankh-Morpork was under the rule of one Lord Snapcase, a man so certain of his own brilliance that it took three guilds, two accountants, and an entire division of wizards to keep him from proving it publicly.<sup class="footnote">1</sup></p>

  <p>The city was, as usual, teetering between chaos and efficiency — and everyone knew which side would win in the end, because chaos was better funded.</p>

  <p>But beneath the noise, in the marble corridors of the Assassins’ Guild, a young man named <strong>Havelock Vetinari</strong> was quietly studying <em>how</em> power worked.</p>

  <p>He wasn’t interested in titles. Titles were fragile.<br>
  He wasn’t interested in fame. Fame got you killed faster than poison.</p>

  <p>He was interested in <em>stability</em>. Which, on the Disc, was generally achieved through the careful, judicious, and entirely deniable removal of unstable people.</p>

  <hr>

  <p><strong>2. An Education in Shadows</strong></p>

  <p>The Guild’s motto was <em>Nil Mortifi Sine Lucre</em> — “No killing without payment.” Vetinari considered this charmingly straightforward but philosophically incomplete.</p>

  <p>He preferred: “No killing without purpose.”<sup class="footnote">2</sup></p>

  <p>He had recently graduated top of his class. This was not because he was stronger, faster, or more daring than his peers — quite the opposite. He had, in fact, managed to avoid every duel, every scandal, and every accidental window-related death that tended to thin the Guild’s student population.</p>

  <p>He was, in short, <em>unremarkable</em> in all the ways that mattered.</p>

  <p>This worried his tutor, Doctor Downey, who had the distinct sense that Havelock Vetinari was quietly <em>remarking</em> on everything else.</p>

  <p>“Mr Vetinari,” Downey had said, “one day you’ll have to stop studying and actually <em>do</em> something.”</p>

  <p>To which Vetinari had replied: “Indeed, sir. I’m simply waiting for something worth doing.”</p>

  <hr>

  <p><strong>3. The Commission</strong></p>

  <p>One misty evening, that <em>something</em> arrived.</p>

  <p>A minor noble, Lord Ventricule, had written a letter to the Guild requesting the “removal” of a certain <strong>Auditor of Taxes</strong>, who had begun asking awkward questions about unpaid levies and suspiciously creative bookkeeping.</p>

  <p>The Guildmaster assigned it as a training contract. “Simple job,” Downey said. “No politics. No moral complications. Perfect for you.”</p>

  <p>Vetinari accepted politely, then spent three days reading <em>everything</em> he could find about Lord Ventricule, the taxman, the taxman’s family, and the way Ankh-Morpork’s tax system had been quietly bleeding citizens for years.</p>

  <p>When he was done, he burned the contract.</p>

  <p>He then wrote a short letter to Lord Ventricule, which said:</p>

  <blockquote>
    “Dear My Lord,<br>
    I have considered your request carefully. I believe I can better serve your interests by a different means.<br>
    Yours with utmost discretion,<br>
    H. Vetinari.”
  </blockquote>

  <p>Then he waited.</p>

  <hr>

  <p><strong>4. The Quiet Solution</strong></p>

  <p>Two weeks later, the Auditor of Taxes was promoted.<br>
  Lord Ventricule’s accounts were audited — thoroughly, and publicly — and found to be perfectly clean.<br>
  And Lord Ventricule himself was appointed <em>Master of Civic Finance</em>, a position that required daily interaction with the very tax system he’d been trying to avoid.</p>

  <p>Nobody died.<br>
  Nobody even knew who to thank.</p>

  <p>Downey summoned Vetinari immediately.</p>

  <p>“Did you <em>not</em> complete your assignment?”</p>

  <p>“I completed the purpose, sir.”</p>

  <p>“The purpose was to remove the Auditor!”</p>

  <p>“Indeed,” Vetinari said mildly. “And I have removed him. From danger.”</p>

  <p>Downey opened his mouth, shut it, and looked vaguely betrayed by logic. “You’ll never make a living this way,” he said finally.</p>

  <p>Vetinari gave him a small smile. “Oh, I rather think I shall.”</p>

  <hr>

  <p><strong>5. The Eye of Snapcase</strong></p>

  <p>Of course, Ankh-Morpork being what it was, good deeds rarely went unnoticed — especially when they smelled faintly of treachery.</p>

  <p>Word reached Lord Snapcase that a young assassin had resolved a potentially explosive scandal without spilling a drop of blood. Snapcase, who liked clever men in the way a cat likes clever mice, summoned Vetinari to his palace.</p>

  <p>The Patrician’s office was large, lavish, and filled with furniture that had died nobly in the service of expense accounts.</p>

  <p>“So!” Snapcase said. “You’re the boy who kills people <em>by promotion</em>.”</p>

  <p>“I prefer to think I make killing unnecessary, sir,” said Vetinari.</p>

  <p>Snapcase grinned the grin of a man who thought he’d found a protégé and hadn’t yet realised he’d found his replacement. “Excellent! I like initiative. We need men like you. You see, government is simply assassination with paperwork!”</p>

  <p>Vetinari bowed. “Indeed, my lord. The key difference being that paperwork leaves witnesses.”</p>

  <p>Snapcase laughed for a full minute. Vetinari did not.</p>

  <hr>

  <p><strong>6. The First Lesson of Power</strong></p>

  <p>Weeks later, as Vetinari was leaving the palace, a messenger approached him in the street.</p>

  <p>“From his lordship,” the boy said, handing him a sealed envelope.</p>

  <p>Inside, written in Snapcase’s grand, untidy scrawl, was a single line:</p>

  <blockquote>“Never let anyone see you as indispensable.”</blockquote>

  <p>Vetinari read it twice, then folded it neatly into his pocket.</p>

  <p>It was good advice.<br>
  He intended to follow it.<br>
  For now.</p>

  <hr>

  <p><strong>7. Shadows Move</strong></p>

  <p>The city slept uneasily that night, as it always did when it suspected the wrong people were awake.</p>

  <p>In the Assassins’ Guild, Downey poured himself a brandy and muttered, “That boy’s going to be trouble.”</p>

  <p>In the palace, Snapcase dreamt of a golden future and woke with a headache he couldn’t name.</p>

  <p>And in a quiet townhouse overlooking the Shades, Havelock Vetinari stared out into the dark city, where the lamplight shimmered on the river like coins sinking in deep water.</p>

  <p>He was thinking about how easy it was to kill a man — and how much more elegant it was to kill a <em>problem</em>.</p>

  <p>He’d learned something valuable tonight. Power didn’t come from wealth, or title, or violence.<br>
  It came from understanding which levers to pull — and which people believed they were the ones pulling them.</p>

  <p>He smiled faintly.</p>

  <p>One day, he thought, the city would need someone to keep all its chaos pointed in the same direction. Someone who understood that stability and fear were, properly applied, the same thing.</p>

  <p>And when that day came, he would already be there — invisible, inevitable, and perfectly polite.</p>

  <p><strong>THE END - for now</strong></p>

  <hr>

  <p class="footnote">
  <sup>1</sup> And, on one memorable occasion, to explain to him that <em>burning down the Guild of Thieves</em> was not a long-term solution to crime.  
  <br><sup>2</sup> He would later refine this to “No killing without civic improvement,” but by then it was really more of a mission statement.

  <p><sup>†</sup> <em>A Note from the Author:</em><br>
  This tale was not written by Sir Terry Pratchett, nor does it pretend to be.<br>
  But for those of us who have loved every word he gave us,<br>
  it’s a small way of keeping that peculiar, wonderful magic alive—<br>
  of feeling, just for a moment, what it’s like to read a new Discworld story for the first time.<br>
  Even if, occasionally, we have to write it ourselves to do so.</p>
