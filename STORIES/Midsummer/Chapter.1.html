    <h1>Midsummer Murders: Ankh-Morpork Division — Chapter 1</h1>
    <div class="meta">Posted by <strong>The Watch House Blog</strong> — <span class="small">Ankh-Morpork, Midsummer Eve</span></div>
  </header>

  <p class="intro">
    If you like your murders politely eccentric, your hedges suspiciously observant, and your law officers
    perpetually cross with the city because it will not behave in the manner they find convenient, then you are
    in precisely the right (and also wrong) place. The body was found on Midsummer Street, at the Bake, Knit & Slightly
    Suspicious Garden show — which is to say: eventful, floral, and opinionated.
  </p>

  <section class="scene">
    <h2>1. The Body in the Sunflower Bed</h2>

    <p>
      It began, as things often begin in Ankh-Morpork, with a noise and a complaint. The complaint came from Mrs Tishworth of
      Midsummer Street (three-time winner of "Most Decidedly Pointed Topiary"), who complained that someone had "ruined the ambiance".
      Ambiance in the city is a fragile thing and needs looking after; it is liable to be trampled underfoot by commerce or common sense.
    </p>

    <p class="quote">
      Someone had indeed ruined the ambiance. A gentleman — neat enough for theft, placid enough for murder — lay face-up amid a circle of
      sunflowers, as if he had been placed there to match the display. The sunflowers looked affronted.
    </p>

    <p>
      There were two things that annoyed Commander Sam Vimes at once. One was that the scene was far too picturesque for a murder in this city.
      The other was the embroidered calling card protruding from the man's pocket: <em>Lord Bartholomew of the Minor Guild of Cake-Toppers (ret.)</em>
      — which in Ankh-Morpork social arithmetic is seldom purely social.
    </p>

    <p class="aside">
      (Note: the phrase "Minor Guild" should not be taken at face value. There is nothing minor about guild politics. They expand like bread in an
      oven and are similarly hard to slice.)
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="scene">
    <h2>2. Arrival: Vimes, Cheery, and the Unauthorised Relative</h2>

    <p>
      The Watch arrived in their usual combination of grim professionalism and accidental chaos. Vimes walked in the manner of a man who
      expected the world to be less honest than it liked to pretend; Cheery Littlebottom carried a kit that hummed, bleeped and seemed
      to feel slightly embarrassed at its sophistication.
    </p>

    <div class="dialogue">
      <p><b>Vimes:</b> "Right. Nobody moves anything until we know whether it wants to stay where it is or not."</p>
      <p><b>Cheery:</b> "We should take samples, sir. Soil, fibres, maybe something from the petals —"</p>
      <p><b>Vimes:</b> "And motives. If we can bag those early, we save ourselves some paperwork later."</p>
    </div>

    <p>
      Then Cully turned up. She appeared at crimes the way pigeons appear at sandwiches: on purpose and with an air of entitlement.
      She had the energy of someone doing "work experience", which in her case meant short shifts across town at places like The Bucket
      (field research, she called it), the Bunch of Grapes, and once at a small establishment that described itself as "a grocer, mainly".
    </p>

    <p>
      Vimes blinked. "Cully. What are you doing here?"
    </p>

    <p>
      "Work experience," she said brightly. "Also, you said I should see more of the city."
    </p>

    <p>
      "I meant from the top of a watchtower, not from the bottom of a sunflower bed."
    </p>

    <p>
      "It’s all education, Dad." She smiled in a way that made the morning look like something it might not have been planning to do. Cheery pretended not
      to look interested, but made a mental note: Cully-on-site would probably complicate logistics and occasionally solve things by accident.
    </p>

  <section class="scene">
    <h2>3. Sykes — The Talking Dog (Who Is Deeply Conflicted About Angua)</h2>

    <p>
      Sykes was a dog, which is to say he was small, grey, unreasonably hopeful, and had a collar that suggested he had once been someone’s idea
      of fashionable. He also talked, which is unfortunate for him and inevitable for the city.
    </p>

    <div class="dialogue">
      <p><b>Sykes:</b> "He smelled of biscuits and other people's money. Proper posh. Like somebody who leaves a coin in charity boxes and tells them it’s a donation."</p>
      <p><b>Vimes:</b> "Talking dog. Of course. Cheery, note it down before he starts composing poetry."</p>
      <p><b>Sykes:</b> "Wouldn’t dare, sir. Not while she’s about."</p>
    </div>

    <p>
      "Her?" Vimes said.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Sergeant Angua, sir." Sykes’s tail gave a small, complicated twitch. "The light of my life and the terror of my nights. Last time she looked at me,
      I apologised to three lampposts and a postbox on the way home. If she smiles at me the wrong way, I will faint, squeal and probably chase my tail
      like a civilian with a sudden conscience."
    </p>

    <p>
      Cheery made an apologetic noise and examined Sykes’s collar. "We’ll swab for trace scents," she said. "And perhaps for unrequited canine longing."
    </p>

    <p class="aside">
      (Dogs in Ankh-Morpork are not ordinarily permitted to be romantic. It is disruptive to the social order and to the postmen.)
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="scene">
    <h2>4. The First Forensic Quirk</h2>

    <p>
      Cheery set about the scene with the serene satisfaction of a scientist who had finally been given permission to have an opinion.
      Vimes, whose job it was to make sure the universe did not hand out answers too quickly, prowled the edges like a man in a hat with
      too many questions.
    </p>

    <div class="dialogue">
      <p><b>Cheery:</b> "There are traces on the cuffs — a fine dust. Not ash, not soot. It looks almost like..."</p>
      <p><b>Vimes:</b> "Magic?"</p>
      <p><b>Cheery:</b> "Biology, actually. If you're asking, sir, I'll check both. We have a box for 'probably both'."</p>
    </div>

    <p>
      The dust glittered like an insult. It was the sort of thing the Alchemists’ Guild used on festive pastries to give them "presence".
      It suggested motives that ranged from petty (blackmail over a secret icing recipe) to dramatic (a tribute gone spectacularly wrong).
    </p>

    <p class="quote">
      Meanwhile, the tea rooms were busy with gossip and trembling cakes. Someone upstairs whispered that Lord Bartholomew had been seen
      arguing with a representative of the Guild of Reluctant Painters the week before. Such disputes often end with bruised egos and the occasional
      missing teaspoon.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="scene">
    <h2>5. Cully Makes a Mistake (And Something Happens)</h2>

    <p>
      While Cheery and the Watch catalogued dust and dignity, Cully slipped behind a hedge in the name of "observational positioning".
      This was an expression her father used with caution; she used it with abandon.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Cully, what are you doing there?" Vimes asked in the tone of a man who had never quite got used to someone being able to climb hedges
      and also justify it.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Listening," she said. "And practicing my 'innocent bystander' face. It’s quite educational."
    </p>

    <p>
      She was not, as it turned out, an innocent bystander. Joyce — no, Sykes (who had earlier politely corrected the name because dogs prefer accuracy) —
      nosed at a loose stone and revealed, hidden beneath it, a small, lacquered tin. Inside the tin was a spoon, several shreds of a folded letter, and
      a small smear of what could have been jam — or something that at a glance smelled much like jam but held the social implications of a scandal.
    </p>

    <p class="quote">
      <strong>Note (translated):</strong> <em>Do not ask after the cakes. Some things should remain in their tins.</em>
    </p>

    <p>
      "Someone left a message in jam," Sykes observed. There are few phrases in English that sound as dignified, and none sound less so than "jam message".
      Cully, who had wanted mystery, found herself holding both it and a spoon and looking as if she had been specifically made to do this job.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="scene">
    <h2>6. The Cliffhanger (Because This Is A Serial)</h2>

    <p>
      As the sundial argued with the clouds and the hedges cast longer, slightly accusatory shadows, Vimes received a small, perfumed note
      slipped beneath the scene tape. His expression narrowed, which in his case is both descriptive and a warning to bystanders.
    </p>

    <p class="quote">
      <strong>Note (translated):</strong> <em>Stop asking about the cakes. Some things belong in tins.</em>
    </p>

    <p>
      Cully looked offended on principle and delighted on purpose. Sykes looked alarmed in a way that suggested he had finally met something more
      intimidating than Angua — namely the idea of unattended pastries. Cheery bottled a small amount of lavender-scented certainty for later testing,
      and Vimes vowed to ask awkward questions until someone provided answers he could staple into a file.
    </p>

    <p class="teaser">
      Next time: a missing spoon with an intriguing pedigree, a Guild meeting that is all civility and sharp elbows, and Vimes trying very hard not to
      be outfoxed by a dog in love and a daughter in training.

      If you enjoyed this opening chapter, drop a note in the comments — especially if you have an opinion on whether hedges have rights,
      or whether jam should be considered evidence. Chapter 2 will continue the investigation inside the Guilds, where politeness and murder
      go hand-in-glove.
