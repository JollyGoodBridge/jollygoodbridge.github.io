    <h1>Midsummer Murders: Ankh-Morpork Division — Chapter 1</h1>
    <div class="meta">Posted by <strong>The Watch House Blog</strong> — <span class="small">Ankh-Morpork, Midsummer Eve</span></div>
  </header>

  <p class="intro">
    If you like your murders politely eccentric, your orchards full of secrets, and your patricians only half-informed,
    then you are politely in the wrong place — but this is Ankh-Morpork, and things have an annoying way of politely correcting themselves.
    The body was found on Midsummer Street, where the annual "Bake, Knit & Slightly Suspicious Garden" show had been in full flower.
  </p>

  <section class="scene">
    <h2>1. The Body in the Sunflower Bed</h2>

    <p>
      It began, as most things do in Ankh-Morpork, with a smell and a complaint. The complaint belonged to Mrs. Tishworth of
      Midsummer Street (three-time winner of "Best Slightly Pointed Topiary"), who had complained that someone had "ruined the ambiance".
      The smell, which is not normally the most trustworthy witness in the city, insisted upon a human rather than any of the usual
      suspects (rats, sewer, porters with onion for breakfast).
    </p>

    <p class="quote">
      Someone had indeed ruined the ambiance. A gentleman — well-dressed enough to have been worth robbing, stationary enough to be worth noticing —
      lay face-up among a circle of sunflowers, as if he had been placed there to compliment the floral arrangement.
    </p>

    <p>
      There were, immediately, two things about the scene that annoyed Commander Sam Vimes. One was that it was far too picturesque for a murder in
      Ankh-Morpork. The other was that the victim's pocket contained an embroidered calling card announcing: <em>Lord Bartholomew of the Minor Guild of
      Cake Toppers (ret.)</em> — which, in the peculiar social arithmetic of the city, is seldom purely social.
    </p>

  <section class="scene">
    <h2>2. Arrival: Vimes, Cheery, and the Visitor</h2>

    <p>
      The Watch arrived with their usual mixture of method and mayhem. Vimes led, with his gait that announced the world to be less honest than it liked to
      pretend; Cheery Littlebottom brought a kit that hummed, bleeped, and was suspiciously proud of its array of brushes.
    </p>

    <div class="dialogue">
      <p><b>Vimes:</b> "Right. Nobody moves anything until we know why it won't stay where it is."</p>
      <p><b>Cheery:</b> "We should take samples, sir. From the soil, the marker—"</p>
      <p><b>Vimes:</b> "From the soil and the marker and the entire senseless social structure that got this man here." (He did not say that last part out loud; it was more of a Vimes thought that came out in gruff undercurrent.)</p>
    </div>

    <p>
      There was also a guest: a recent and rather disconcerted arrival from a place where murder is a weekend hobby with better teas. He called himself
      Cully — Cully of Midsomer, he insisted, though the name suited him as a whale might fit into a teacup. He had come with the sort of earnestness
      that makes priests and visiting magistrates weep from hope.
    </p>

    <p class="quote">
      "We had a man from home," Cully said, holding his hat as if it had a proper place in the world. "He said gardeners here do splendid things with hedges.
      I'm here to learn. Also," — here he lowered his voice to a stage whisper — "there's a tradition of three confessions at once in my county. Is that...
      socially acceptable here?"
    </p>

    <p>
      Vimes regarded Cully as one regards a particularly flammable substance left unattended in a library. He nodded once. "Not usually," he said.
    </p>

  <section class="scene">
    <h2>3. Joyce — The Talking Dog (Who Wishes She Were Not)</h2>

    <p>
      Joyce, by contrast, was emphatically of Ankh-Morpork. A smallish mongrel with ambitions and a collar that suggested she had once
      been fashionable, she had the misfortune to be able to talk. The ability-to-talk is, in this city, often a genetic bonus and a social liability.
      Joyce had been found sitting on the victim's boots and offering a running commentary on the neighbourhood's plant choices.
    </p>

    <div class="dialogue">
      <p><b>Joyce:</b> "He smelled like someone who'd once been in a very polite club and then decided to explore the queue at the Assassins' Guild. Sorry,
      I shouldn't say 'polite' exactly. Who are you then?"</p>
      <p><b>Vimes:</b> (to Cheery) "Make a note: talking dog. Also note: it is probably lying."</p>
      <p><b>Cheery:</b> "We should swab the collar. And the muzzle. Often dogs pick up trace scents humans would not."</p>
    </div>

    <p>
      Joyce, who was not entirely without manners, offered Cully a small, reproachful look as he reached out to stroke her head. Cully tried to oblige the dog
      with the sort of affectionate pat you give to characters in novels. Joyce accepted the note but made it clear, in a voice that would not be contradicted,
      that if anyone declared the hedges "delightful" she would bite their discourtesy.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="scene">
    <h2>4. The First Forensic Quirk</h2>

    <p>
      Cheery set about the scene with the serene satisfaction of a practitioner who has finally been given permission to be useful. Vimes, meanwhile,
      performed the Vimes duty of intervening whenever the universe tried to hand out answers too early.
    </p>

    <div class="dialogue">
      <p><b>Cheery:</b> "There are traces of something on the cuffs — a fine dust. Not ash, not soot. It looks almost like..."</p>
      <p><b>Vimes:</b> "Magic?"</p>
      <p><b>Cheery:</b> "Biology, actually. If you're asking, sir, I will check both." (Cheery's tone suggested also that they had both in their kit, just in case.)</p>
    </div>

    <p>
      The dust glittered like an insult; it was the sort of thing patrons of the Alchemists' Guild used on special pastries to make them "festive".
      It also suggested motive: blackmail over a recipe, a guildly grudge, or a tribute gone spectacularly wrong.
    </p>

    <p class="quote">
      Meanwhile, upstairs in the nearest tea room where conspiracies like to have scones, someone had whispered that Lord Bartholomew had been seen
      arguing the week before with a representative of the Guild of Reluctant Painters. This is the sort of lead that invites both suspicion and
      a tray of very nervous cakes.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="scene">
    <h2>5. The Cliffhanger (Because This Is A Blog Serial)</h2>

    <p>
      As the sun dipped and the hedges cast longer, slightly accusatory shadows, Vimes received a small, perfumed note that made his expression do
      something curious: it narrowed.
    </p>

    <p class="quote">
      <strong>Note (translated):</strong> <em>Stop asking about the cakes. Some things should remain in their tins.</em>
    </p>

    <p>
      Meanwhile, Joyce sniffed something at the edge of the hedge and made a sound that, if translated, would have meant: <em>There's someone in the hedgerow,
      and they are pretending to be a shrub.</em> Cully gasped in the manner of the newly initiated, and Cheery prepared a small bottle of something that
      promised to be useful and also smell faintly of lavender and certainty.
    </p>

    <p class="teaser">
      Next time: a missing spoon, an unexpected confession, and Vimes trying very hard not to be outfoxed by a talking dog and a visitor from Midsomer.

      Chapter 2 will continue the investigation inside the Guilds, where politeness and murder go hand-in-glove.
