    Author's note: 
            
I didn‚Äôt start this blog because I‚Äôm some kind of bridge expert bursting with wisdom to share‚Äîor because I‚Äôm a seasoned blogger who knows how to publish, promote, or harness AI like a pro. Quite the opposite, in fact.
This whole venture is about learning‚Äîespecially for me. I‚Äôve been playing bridge for about two years, and you‚Äôll hear a bit about that journey as we go. Professionally, I‚Äôve spent my career in customer service, business and systems analysis, project and programme management, and, for the last decade, consultancy. I‚Äôve commissioned and managed some very successful websites‚Äîthough, ironically, I‚Äôve never built one myself.
Now, in semi-retirement (with full retirement pending the day I stop answering the phone), I find myself with both time on my hands and an itch to learn. Bridge fascinates me. Blogging intrigues me. And AI? Well, that‚Äôs equal parts exciting and slightly terrifying. Not because I think it‚Äôs about to take over the world, but because it‚Äôs already changing how we do things in ways we‚Äôve barely begun to understand.
So here I am‚Äîtrying to learn more about bridge, more about writing and publishing, and more about AI. If, by the end of this adventure, I can spot an endplay at the bridge table and know which AI to trust when formatting a paragraph (without falling for its occasional hallucinations), I‚Äôll call that a win.
And speaking of hallucinations‚Äîwho knew that AIs had them? Sounds like a script for the next sci-fi blockbuster.

Hopefully, you‚Äôll find something here that‚Äôs at least a little interesting, possibly informative, and maybe even entertaining.
