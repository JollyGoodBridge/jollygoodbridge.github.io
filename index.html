    Author's note: i did not start this blog because i know so much about the game of bridge that i felf the need to share, or that i know so much 
            about writting blog posts, how to publish them effectivly, or even making the most of AI. IN FACT THE OPPOSITE IS TRUE IN ALL CASES.  This is an opportunity to learn, especially for me.
            I have been learning bridge for 2 years, and tou will hear a little about that as we progress.  As a business consultant I have commisioned and managed some very succesful websites, although i have never built one myself.
            With a history in Customer Service, Business and Systems analysis, Project and Programme Management and for the last ten years Consultancy i now find the advent of AI both exiting and a little scary.  Not because i think it will take over tje world but rather that Ai will change how we do things in ways we have yet only glimpsed, 
            and for my part I know nothing of how far it has come so far or its limitations.  So here I am,in semi retirement (aiming for the real deal as soon as i can persuade myself to stop answering the phone.  with time on my h
            ands and a wish to learn more about the game of Bridge, more about writting and publishing a blog, and more about AI.

            This blog is for now at least my attempt at achieving the above with some structure and something to show for it at the end, although if all I manage is the ability to spot an end play opportunity at the bridge table and to know the best AI to use to help marshall facts, format and present copy, while avoiding the result of AI" hallucination, then i will win.  Wow, just learning that AI's 
            halluinate, ist that a script for your next sci-fi flick!

            Hopefully you will find some of what i write interesting and or informative
